# Pendeteksi-gempa-dan-tsunami
Application to provide earthquake and tsunami warning information using the BMKG (Badan Meteorologi Klimatologi dan Geofisika) API. This app was built to fulfill the task of the Dicoding SIB capstone project. Here we demonstrate the use of Modern Android development tools - (Kotlin, Architecture Components, MVVM, LiveData, Material Components)


## Developed by
- Mohamad Zaelani
- Ilham Maulana


## Built With
- [BMKG API](https://data.bmkg.go.id/) - BMKG Open Data
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes. 
  - [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [GSON](https://github.com/google/gson) - A Java serialization/deserialization library to convert Java Objects into JSON and back.
- [GSON Converter](https://github.com/square/retrofit/tree/master/retrofit-converters/gson) - A Converter which uses Gson for serialization to and from JSON.
- [OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/okhttp) -  For implementing interceptor, logging and mocking web server.
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - An image loading and caching library for Android focused on smooth scrolling.
- [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) - Maps and location for developers

## Architecture
This app uses [***MVVM (Model View View-Model)***](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#recommended-app-arch) architecture.
